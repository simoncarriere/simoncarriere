## Hi, I'm Simon. A purpose driven, full stack developer & product strategist

- 👀 After years of freelancing, I’m looking to join an ambitious and aligned team on a mission to build innovative solutions to bold problems.
- 📍Based in Montreal, available anywhere.
- 🤔 I'm excited about design systems and collaborative & generative user interfaces!

### I'm currently building : 

1. [Bivi.io](https://bivi.io) helping small async teams supercharge their productivity in real time.
2. [Hellosupersaas.com](https://hellosupersaas.com) helping founders race to their MVPs.

Lets connect on Twitter [@simonsjournal](https://twitter.com/simonsjournal) or email me at [hello@simonsjournal.com](mailto:hello@simonsjournal.com)
