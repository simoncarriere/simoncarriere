## Hi, I'm Simon. A purpose driven, full stack developer & product strategist

👀 After years of freelancing, I’m looking to join an ambitious and aligned team on a mission to build innovative solutions to bold problems.

🤔 I'm excited about multiplayer interfaces, generative user interfaces and design systems!
